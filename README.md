# Lab 10 - Visualizations with Matplotlib

For this lab, you will look at one of many interesting datasets that are freely available on the internet.

## Step 1 - Import packages
Go to the [CORGIS website](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/python/) and choose a dataset you find interesting.

You will need to download the materials and upload to your new Python project in Replit.


## Step 2 - Explore the data
Since every dataset will be slightly different, you will need to determine how the data is stored, what field are of interest, and how we can access those specific areas.

For most of the datasets, there are additional resources describing where the data was gathered and how up to date the data is.

## Step 3 - Plotting the Data
There are many methods of plotting data. Use the data visualization tools of Matplotlib and the data organization tool of Pandas to format the data so it can be visually expressed.


## Step 4 - Clean the Data
There may be data points that cause the data visualization to be skewed or otherwise difficult to read. Remove these data from the set programatically (through the code, not by erasing them from the data file).

## Step 5 - Explain your graphics
- What story does this data tell?
- How did your visualization assist in making that clear?


## Further Exploration
There are many other tools to plot information on a map. Here are some more resources to explore.
